# Get started

## Home page
> On the home page, the user has three precise options for interaction. First, the user may access the Guestbook Page to view the total number of entries recorded by previous visitors. Second, the user may click theÂ New Message PageÂ button to submit a message by entering specific details, including username, country, and message content. Third, the user may select theÂ Ajax Message PageÂ button to provide the same information as on the New Message Page. However, on this page, the submitted message appears instantly without requiring a refresh, ensuring immediate confirmation of the entered information.

## Guestbook page
> On theÂ Guestbook page, users can view entries submitted by others, including each contributorâ€™s name, country, and message. This page provides a clear record of shared content, allowing visitors to read and understand contributions from different individuals across locations. After reviewing the guestbook entries, users can easily return to the main interface by clicking theÂ Back to HomeÂ button, which redirects them directly to the Home page for continued navigation and further interaction with the platformâ€™s available features.

## Newmessage page
> On theÂ New Message page, users are required to provide three specific inputs: username, country, and message content. All fields must be completed before submission; if any field is left empty, the system prevents the message from being posted. Once the user enters the required details and clicks theÂ Submit MessageÂ button, the information is recorded, and the system automatically redirects the user to theÂ Home page. This ensures a smooth transition after completing the entry process. However, if the user chooses not to complete the form, they can return to theÂ Home pageÂ by selecting theÂ Back to HomeÂ button. This option allows users to exit the form without submitting any data while maintaining consistent navigation.

## Ajax message page
> On theÂ Ajax Message page, users follow the same procedure as on theÂ New Message pageÂ by entering their username, country, and message. After completing the required fields, they click theÂ Submit via AJAXÂ button to publish the message. Unlike the standard submission process, the Ajax method displays the result immediately at the bottom of the page without requiring a reload. The displayed result includes the submitted username, country, message content, and the exact date of posting, ensuring users receive instant confirmation of their entry. This real-time update enhances the interaction experience and saves time. If users choose to leave the page instead of submitting a message, they can return to theÂ Home pageÂ by clicking theÂ Back to HomeÂ button.
